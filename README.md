## Introduction
dlengine is a trainning engine targeting to separating miscellaneous trainning things from modeling.


With dlengine, you can focuse on building model. dlengine takes care of logging, model saving and restoring, very efficient multi-gpu training for you.


dlengine contains features:
- very efficient multi-gpu training based on `DistributedDataParallel`
- automatic logging 
- automatic model saving and restoring


## Usage
step 1. inheriting from `DefaultTrainer`ï¼Œoverwrite neccesary methods `build_model`, `build_optimizer`, `build_lr_scheduler`, `build_train_loader`, `build_test_loader`, `build_evaluator`.
```python
from dlengine.defaults import DefaultTrainer

class Trainer(DefaultTrainer):
    def __init__(self, args):
        super(Trainer, self).__init__(args, args.output_dir, "classifier", args.num_epoch, args.log_every_n_epoch)

    @classmethod
    def build_model(cls, args):
        pass

    @classmethod
    def build_optimizer(cls, args, model):
        pass

    @classmethod
    def build_lr_scheduler(cls, args, end_iter, optimizer):
        pass

    @classmethod
    def build_train_loader(cls, args):
        pass

    @classmethod
    def build_test_loader(cls, args):
        pass

    @classmethod
    def build_evaluator(cls, args):
        pass
```

step 2. call `lanuch`function to start training

```python
from dlengine.launch import launch
from dlengine.defaults import default_setup
def main(args):
    default_setup(args.output_dir, "classifier", args)
    trainer = Trainer(args)
    return trainer.train()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    args = parser.parse_args()
    launch(
        main,
        num_gpus_per_machine=args.num_gpu,
        dist_url="tcp://127.0.0.1:28662",
        num_machines=1,
        machine_rank=0,
        args=(args,))
```

## Installation

1. install package dependencies: pytorch and termcolor. 

2. `pip install dlengine`
